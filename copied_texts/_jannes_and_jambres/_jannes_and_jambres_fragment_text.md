Brit. Lib., Cotton, Tiberius B.V., fol. 87
Mambres opened the magical books
of his brother Jannes; he performed
necromancy
and brought up from the netherworld
his brother’s shade. The soul
of Jannes said in response,
] your brother did not die
unjustly, but indeed justly,
and the judgment will go
against me, since I was more
clever than all clever magicians,
and opposed the two brothers,
Moses and Aaron, who performed
great signs and wonders.
As a result I died and was
brought from among (the living)
to the netherworld where there is
great burning and the pit of
perdition, whence no ascent is
possible. Now then, brother Mambres.
