# Background Information

**The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs** is a collection of writings attributed to the twelve sons of Jacob, also known as the twelve tribes of Israel[_{{{CITATION{{{_3{Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testaments_of_the_Twelve_Patriarchs). These texts are considered part of the apocryphal scriptures and are believed to be pseudepigraphical works, meaning they were written by authors who attributed their writings to these patriarchs[_{{{CITATION{{{_3{Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testaments_of_the_Twelve_Patriarchs). The collection is thought to have reached its final form in the 2nd century CE and includes ethical teachings and exhortations to follow God's commandments[_{{{CITATION{{{_3{Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testaments_of_the_Twelve_Patriarchs).
