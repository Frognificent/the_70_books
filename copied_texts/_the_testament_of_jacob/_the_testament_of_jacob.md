# The Testament of Jacob

## Chapter 1

Now it came to pass when the time had come for our beloved father Jacob the patriarch, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, to go forth from the body (and the God-loving Jacob was well on in years), the Lord sent Michael the archangel to him. And he said to him, "Israel, my beloved, you righteous root, write your words of instruction for your sons, and draw up your testament for them, and concern yourself about those of your household, for the time has come for you to go to your fathers and rejoice with them for ever." And when the God-loving Jacob heard this from the angel, he answered and said to him, "My lord" — for it was his daily custom to talk to angels. He said to him, "May the will of the Lord be done."

## Chapter 2

And God blessed our father Jacob. He made for himself a place apart, to which he withdrew and offered his prayers to God day and night, while the angels visited him and guarded him and kept him safe and gave him strength in everything. God blessed him; and his people increased greatly in numbers in the land of Egypt.

For at the time he went down to Egypt to his son Joseph, his sight was failing as a result of continual weeping and worrying over his son Joseph; but after he arrived in Egypt and had seen his son Joseph's face, he saw everything clearly again. And Jacob Israel flung on his son Joseph's neck; he greeted him with tears and said: ‘Now let me die, for I have seen your face once more while you are still alive, my beloved.’ And Joseph ruled over the whole of Egypt. Jacob lived in the land of Goshen for seventeen years. He became very old and attained a great age: he kept all the commandments and lived always in the fear of the Lord: and his sight failed so that he could see no one because of extreme old age.
